# CodeHistory SwiftUI iOS App

This is my first Swift App. It is the last project of the CodeCademy [Build iOS Apps with SwiftUI](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-ios-apps-with-swiftui) course.
I learned a lot about native mobile development and after finishing the course, I am interested in diving deeper into the topic.
